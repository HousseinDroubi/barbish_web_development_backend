Database relationships describe how tables are connected to each other.

Types of relationships:

a)One-to-One (1:1)
One row in a table is related to one row in another table.

b)One-to-Many (1:N)
One row in a table is related to many rows in another table (the most common type).

c)Many-to-Many (M:N)
Rows in one table can relate to many rows in another table, and vice versa.
➡️ In this case, you need a new table (called a link table) to store the relationships.
